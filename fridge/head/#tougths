Everyone’s fighting their own battles, even if you can’t see it. Time just keeps going and most of the stuff we stress about now won’t even matter later. Memories fade and sometimes they aren’t even true. The stuff we rely on, like society or nature, can fall apart faster than we think. You can feel completely alone even when you’re surrounded by people; real connection doesn’t just happen.
